Open Dictionary
===============

Version 0.0.5 [Linux/Unix only]
Developed and tested with wxGtk 2.2.7

Project's homepage: http://opendict.sourceforge.net

Compilation
-----------

Type `make'.


You have to
-----------

Create 2 directories:
$ mkdir ~/.opendict
$ mkdir ~/.opendict/dictionaries

Unzip a demonstrative dictionary file with GNU Zip and copy it:
$ gunzip terminai.dwa.gz
$ cp terminai.dwa ~/.opendict/dictionaries

Copy (and edit or look at) your config file:
$ copy opendictrc ~/.opendict/

If you won't do that, Open Dictionary will catch file errors and create
your directories, and will create config file there. But do nothing with
terminai.dwa.gz file, so, if you compile and run a program, you'll see
empty widgets.

file "terminai.dwa" is used for a `slowo' dictionary of this program for
testing (and using :).
terminai.dwa -- English-Lithuanian terms dictionary from 
http://www.lietuvybe.org/.


Requirements
------------

You need wxWindows libraries (2.2.7) to compile and run this program. You 
can find it at http://www.wxwindows.org.


Platform
--------

This version (0.0.4) was made on Debian GNU/Linux and was tested only here. 
The compatibility with Win32 and other platform will be made in the future.

Have Fun!
